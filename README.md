#CameraViewer-v-1-0

Using an application installed in a computer, the classroom monitoring system will allow the user to access the camera installed in a room in real time. The application will automatically record video at the start of the camera, and will continuously record video clips with a length of 5 minutes each until the camera is terminated. This will also allow the user to save a snapshot taken from the camera.
